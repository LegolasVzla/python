Redis as cache of Postgres and PubSub with LISTEN/NOTIFY
------------------------

This is an example of the logic to use in case where redis is used, as cache of postgres. In architectures oriented to microservices, it's very useful to keep the power of postgres as DBMS, and allow the fast communication needed by the microservices to Redis. We can use PubSub design pattern in this context, using LISTEN/NOTIFY of postgres, of course, exists another kind of solutions for this type of architecture, but postgres offers to you all you need :)

For this example, i'll use **Edamam** API, to get a chunk of information. First of all, you'll need to register and get your own "app_id" and "app_key", you can find all the documentation here: https://developer.edamam.com/food-database-api-docs

Create your virtualenv and install the requirements:

	virtualenv virtual_name --python=python3
	source virtual_name/bin/activate

	pip install -r requirements.txt

Execute the wizard installer:

	sudo ./env/bin/python wizard_installer.py 

Assuming that "env" is the name of your virtualenv and it's located inside of the **pyPubSubPostgreSqlRedis** folder. The wizard will generate a **settings.ini** file, with the enviroment variables, related with the credentials of the API, postgres and redis configuration. It also will create the PostgreSql database, with all the statement in a **main_postgres_db_config.sh** file and execute, all the database elements contained in the folder **pubsub_db** folder. By last, the wizard also will start redis-server service. The structure of the **settings.ini** file, is described below:

	[pgConf]
	DB_NAME=dbname
	DB_USER=user
	DB_PASS=pass
	DB_HOST=host
	DB_PORT=port

	[redisConf]
	R_DB=dbNumber
	R_HOST=host
	R_PORT=port

	[appConf]
	APP_KEY=key
	APP_ID=id

Also, configuration for logging with 2 levels: ERROR (by output console and .log file) and INFO (by .log file):

	[loggers]
	keys=root

	[handlers]
	keys=consoleHandler

	[formatters]
	keys=sampleFormatter

	[logger_root]
	level=INFO
	handlers=consoleHandler

	[handler_consoleHandler]
	class=StreamHandler
	level=ERROR
	formatter=sampleFormatter
	args=(sys.stdout,)

	[formatter_sampleFormatter]
	format=%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s

And that's it. Now you can execute the pubSub.py file:

	python pubSub.py

In this example you could find the basic logic for this kind of architecture, **Publishâ€“subscribe patter**.  

Also in case of redis failure (e.g. Lost data in redis), you can execute "redisResetLoad.py3" to get all the information from postgres, and then, store again in redis.
